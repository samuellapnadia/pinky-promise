1. How I did the checklist step by step:
 a. I started by initializing a git configuration with git init inside a folder I created (pinky-promise), pinky-promise itself will become the name of my store that I created
 b. next I configured my email and username that i use in GitHub and also configured the authentication with the brew install git-credential-manager-core command, then verify it with git config --list
 c. After that, I initialized a repository in github. I created a repository with the name pinky-promise
 d. Then back in the terminal, I created a new main branch with the command git branch -M main and connected it with my github repository with the command git remote add origin HTTPS URL

3. GIT itself is a DevOps tool that is used for source-code management. GIT is used for software development since its branches are easy to merge and cheap as well. This also facilitates the feature branch workflow in which these feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to the codebase. 
4. Based on my personal experience, I felt like Django is an easy to use web framework. Django also allows us to write our desired app without having to reinvent the wheel since Django takes care of much of the web development hassle
